Python Basics for Data Science(very simple way)

# First of fall you have to insatall "Anaconda" link :https://www.anaconda.com/ according to your OS .

# Why we use "anaconda" tools :- Now, if you are primarily doing data science work, Anaconda is also a great option. Anaconda is created by Continuum Analytics, and it is a Python distribution that comes preinstalled with lots of useful python libraries for data science.
Anaconda is popular because it brings many of the tools used in data science and machine learning with just one install, so itâ€™s great for having short and simple setup.
Like Virtualenv, Anaconda also uses the concept of creating environments so as to isolate different libraries and versions. Anaconda also introduces its own package manager, called conda, from where you can install libraries.
Additionally, Anaconda still has the useful interaction with pip that allows you to install any additional libraries which are not available in the Anaconda package manager.

# And clone my project

# Then open annaconda nvigator app 

# In annaconda nvigator app you can see dasdboard then Jupyter notebook and you have any code ediing tools that showing annaconda nvigator app

# If you are opening jupyter note book then you open you project folder where you have to save and then open file and run program.
